        <h1>Kunyan Li</h1>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Kunyan, 4th year undergrad at Queen's University. 
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          My research interests are both foundational and applied cryptography, particularly Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Post-Quantum Cryptography 
          and Secure Multiparty Computation.

      <a href="#">2025.7.27. My group moved onto a new encoder called pitch control encoder. We bought some chips to redesign. The wind turbine company wants a
        robust multi-turn absolute encoder. This type is supposed to be a giant one!
      </a>

      <a href="#">2025.6.7 Mr.Xiong wants me to look up for 3-Channel Nonius Encoder. This one is interesting! Nonius encoding is essentially cryptosystem! </a>

      <a href="#">2025.5.8. I'm now at the office of ENCODER Shenzhen. Some readings before work</a>

      <a href="#">2025.3.11 Prof. Xiong from CIOMP gave me a referral to his brother's company called ENCODER (英科达光电) two days ago. I got interviewed by Mr.Xiong.</a>
  
      <a href="#">2024.8.19 Job ends. Goodbye Germany!</a>

      <a href="#">2024.6.26 I finally talked with Prof. Abetz today! He gave me something to read.  </a>

      <a href="#">2024.6.2 First day at lab! I was told there might be some computation on molecular dynamics......Not sure how to start with this..... </a>
      <a href="#">2024.3.18. I just got interviewed and given oral offer by Dr. Rishun Li. I will be joining a group led by Dr. Zhenzhen Zhang. Zhang's group is
        working on membranes in Germany. They need a student to do CFD simulation for them. Can't wait to do some programming about physics!
      </a>
      <a href="#">2023.7.19. Finally some progress with MFCNet. We were so confused this month since the attention-guided pyramid pooling module did not
         outperform the baseline model. (actually worse) Prof. Xiong believe it was because we don't have enough training data. Even though we now have a model
         with 5% higher accuracy than AGPCNet, I still think there is still room to improve. The key should be at the data labelling and bounding box.
      </a>
      <a href="#">2023.5.21.
        First time being an RA! I am honored to be supervised by Prof. Wenzhuo Xiong at CIOMP (Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Machines
         and Physics 中国科学院长春光学精密机械与物理研究所)
